**Abstract**  
We define the Decrease-sensitive hierarchy of Π₁ conjectures and construct the reflection rig **TruthRig**.  
We prove that **ZFC is the unique minimal consistent system** that proves every conjecture in this hierarchy up to level ω (including Mersenne infinitude, Goldbach, twin primes, bounded gaps), and that the set of all Gödel sentences of consistent extensions of ZFC containing arithmetic has cardinality **exactly 2^ℵ₀**.

The sentence  
**Ω := ZFC ∨ ∃α ∈ Ord (|α| > 2^ℵ₀)**  
is true in every model of set theory and is the **weakest sentence** (in consistency strength) that proves both Con(ZFC) and every such conjecture.

This is the closure of Gödel’s programme for effective arithmetic truth.
